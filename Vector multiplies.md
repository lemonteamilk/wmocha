# Vector multiplies.

## 1. Dot products

A dot products of two vectors **a** and **b**

**a** ${ \bullet}$ **b** =|**a**|${\bullet}$ |**b**|**cos**${\theta}$  

where the ${\theta	}$  refers to the angles between the two vectors.

## 2. Vector products

A vector products of two vectors **a** and **b** 

**a** ${\times}$ **b** = |**a**|${\bullet}$|**b**|**sin**${\theta}$**n**

The value equals to the parallelogon with sides of **a** and **b**.
